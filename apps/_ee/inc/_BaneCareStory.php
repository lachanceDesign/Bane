<h1>The BaneCare Story</h1>  <hr /> <p><span style="color:#3399cc"><span style="font-size:18px"><em>Today, more than 50 years after its start, BaneCare continues its family tradition&mdash;caring for others as we would want to be cared for ourselves.</em></span></span><br /> &nbsp;</p>  <div class="shadow" style="background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:40px;"> <p>Even before he owned a nursing home, George Bane knew what it took to care for loved ones. George had been running his own business selling housewares and clothing, when in 1959 he sold his business to buy the Avalon Nursing Home in Lynn, MA. Soon thereafter, he built Abbott House, and these two facilities quickly became that community&rsquo;s trusted establishment for skilled nursing care and the foundation on which BaneCare is built.<br /> &nbsp;</p>  <div class="btgrid"> <div class="row row-1"> <div class="col col-md-4"> <div class="content"> <p><a href="/apps/_ee/files/clip_image002.png" rel="prettyPhoto"><img alt="Daily Evening Item, Lynn, MA., Tuesday January 8, 1963" class="shadow" src="/apps/_ee/files/clip_image002.png" style="height:286px; margin-bottom:15px; margin-right:15px; width:181px" title="" /></a><br /> <strong><em>Daily Evening Item</em></strong>, Lynn, MA., January 8, 1963<a href="/apps/_ee/files/clip_image002.png" rel="prettyPhoto"> </a></p> </div> </div>  <div class="col col-md-8"> <div class="content"> <div>Now more than a generation later, under the direction of George&rsquo;s son, Richard, the company has grown into one of Massachusetts&rsquo; premier long-term care organizations. Richard has expanded BaneCare beyond its original North Shore roots and today Bane Care provides services across Massachusetts. Yet, despite its growth, BaneCare proudly continues to maintain a strong sense of family, community, and individuality.</div>  <p><br /> Today, the company currently includes a third generation of the Bane family and now operates and manages fourteen skilled nursing and rehabilitation facilities, three adult day centers, and two assisted living facilities spanning the North Shore, South Shore, Berkshires and Greater Boston area.<br /> <br /> Our original motto, &ldquo;A Matter of Trust,&rdquo; is still at the heart of Bane Care&rsquo;s mission today. The company strives to combine the best of the past, present and future &mdash;old fashioned, family values joined with complex medical care capability and advancing technology.
