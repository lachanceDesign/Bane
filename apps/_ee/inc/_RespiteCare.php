<div> <h1>Respite Care</h1>  <hr /> <p>Our facilities are also here to support families who prefer to care for their loved ones at home. BaneCare offers respite stays to create an opportunity and resource for caregivers to have time for themselves &ndash; whatever the reason. Respite stays provide reprieve for those who experience unforeseen circumstances, need to travel or tend to personal obligations, or simply, require relief for a moment in time.</p>  <p>During a respite stay with BaneCare, your loved one will receive the same quality of care and compassion as they would at home, and we will work together with you to ensure a seamless transition.</p>  <p><span style="font-size:16px"><br /> <em><strong><u><a href="/Contact">Contact us</a></u> today for more information!</strong></em></span></p> </div>
