Once the homestead of Senator W. Murray Crane, and home of Winthrop Crane, Sugar Hill is situated on 19 acres of land. The two-story Georgian Revival-style mansion was constructed in 1907-1909. Sugar Hill has hosted three U.S. Presidents, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge and William Howard Taft and renowned performers, such as Cole Porter and Ella Fitzgerald, performed in the music room. As the mansion was converted to today&#39;s use, high quality assisted living, all the gorgeous design and architectural elements of the structure were painstakingly preserved for the enjoyment of our residents and visitors. Come join us for tour to learn more about elegant, comfortable living at Sugar Hill.</p>
